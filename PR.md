# Pull Requests

* Pull Requests should be reviewed at most 48hs after the review was requested, though we should strive for 24hs.
* If the reviewer is not able to make it, they should let the author know.
* To make the reviewer's life easier, we should aim for small PRs. 
* If this is not possible, split the PRs in commits that can be reviewed individually.
* It's ok for a reviewer to send partial reviews.
