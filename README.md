# code-style

Code style guidelines and rules for Zeppelin projects.

## Solidity

To check the code style of smart contracts written in Solidity, we use
[solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium), with the rules in
[.soliumrc.json](.soliumrc.json).

## Javascript

To check the code style of code written in Javascript, we use
[eslint](https://eslint.org/), with the rules in
[.eslintrc](.eslintrc).
